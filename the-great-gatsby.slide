* Let's build a website...

* how about....a blog!

* unicorn.computer

* Options?

* Server-rendered / templating
- run-time assembly, rendering on server
- e.g. handle GET/POST request, fetch data, create HTML strings, reply...
- stack: usually servers + DB
- think: ~LAMP stack, perl scripts, express w/ pug (nÃ©e jade), &c.

*  been there, done that...

* fancier server-rendered
- still run-time assembly, dynamic content loading
- stack: usually servers + DB
- think: rails (turbolinks), phoenix (live view), laravel, &c.
- still server-side but w/ fancier fetching

* maybe later...

* client-rendered
- run-time assembly
- serve client via CDN, fetch data from server
- think: most web apps today

* bad SEO experience, not worth it...

* "JAM" stack
- "JAM" => JavaScript, APis, and Markdown
- ahead-of-time (AOT) assembly / compile-time assembly
- i.e., prerender all paths to static content where possible
- everything else else => APIs
- often: backend-as-a-service (Firebase, Stich, &c.)

* seems cool!

* Enter Gatsby.js

* Gatsby
- "static site generator"
- use React for views and GraphQL for data
- JAM-style architecture
- lots of plugins
- strong commnunity

* Architecture

* Tradeoffs
- useful for static sites and even some dynamic ones
- little to no cost
- build time increases as site expands
- best practices made easy

* Show me

* Working with Gatsby
- querying data
- working with GraphQL
- deploying

* et voila
- [[https://unicorn.computer][unicorn.computer]]

* what's next?

* best of both
- automatic static optimizaton: automatic static pages where possible, dynamic elsewhere
- edge graphQL APIs
